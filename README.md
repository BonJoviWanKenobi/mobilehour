# The Mobile Hour

Hello there, intrepid explorer of code!
Welcome to "The Mobile Hour”, an ecommerce web application that uses React for the frontend, and Node, Express, and MySQL for the backend. Features of this application include CRUD operations, role-based access control, filtering, (mediocre) design, a working cart, and a (somewhat) functional checkout process. She may not be pretty, but she works, and I’m here to tell you brave souls exactly how. 

## The Treasure Map (aka Repository URL)

Your journey begins at: https://github.com/BonJoviWanKenobi/mobilehour.git


##  Prerequisites:
* Node.js and npm: Our backend's favourite runtime (npm should be included in your Node.js install). 
*	MySQL: The place where we keep all our secrets . . . I mean, data.
*	MySQL Workbench (Because who doesn't like visual tools?)
*	A cup of coffee – it can’t hurt. 

##	Setup the Database:
1. Open MySQL Workbench. Create a new connection using the following credentials:
*	Username: root
*	Password: root
2. Once connected, import the database dump:
*	Go to Server > Data Import.
*	Choose Import from Self-Contained File and select the "themobilehourdatabase.sql" file.
*	Click Start Import.

##	Clone The Repository (in your terminal):
  git clone https://github.com/BonJoviWanKenobi/mobilehour.git


##	Set Sail with The Backend 
  Install the dependencies for the backend in the root folder:
  npm install
 

##	Set Course to the Frontend:
Navigate to the backend and do the same:
* cd frontend
* npm install

##	Land, Ahoy! (Start the Project):
1. Start the backend from the root directory:
* npm start
 
2. Launch the frontend from its respective directory:
* cd frontend
* npm start

And there you go! You should now be sailing smoothly on http://localhost:3000/ with the wind in your hair and "The Mobile Hour" in front of you.

## Troubles on Your Journey? 
Remember, every sailor, no matter how experienced, faces challenges. If you encounter any sea monsters (aka bugs), feel free to drop a message in a bottle (or, you know, just use GitHub issues).

## Final Thoughts 
This has been a wild ride! Thanks for sailing with "The Mobile Hour". I hope your journey was as thrilling as a sea shanty sung under a starry night. If not, well . . . I  tried. And as always, pull requests are like friendly dolphins - always welcome!
